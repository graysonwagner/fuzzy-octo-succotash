MERN Challenge: Book Search Engine

Your Challenge this module is emblematic of the fact that most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. 
This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. 
And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.
